    A representation of valid ``Unit`` instances.

    All base and derived units loaded from the configuration file, `cfg.yaml`,

    Parameters
    ----------
    config: str, optional
        Path of a ``YAML`` configuration file, which can be a custom file, and
        defaults to the provided file, ``cfg.yaml``. Custom configuration files
        must match the format of the default configuration file.
    other: dict, optional
        Dictionary for additional units.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from ansys.units import UnitRegistry, Unit
    >>> ureg = UnitRegistry()
    >>> assert ureg.kg == Unit(units="kg")
    >>> fps = Unit("ft s^-1")
